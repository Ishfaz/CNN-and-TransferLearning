# CNNs and Transfer Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the implementation and understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch. The project focuses on building a simple CNN model for image classification and extends to applying transfer learning techniques with pretrained models.

## Objectives
- **Implement CNN**: Learn to construct and train a Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
- **Leverage Transfer Learning**: Utilize a pretrained model to adapt to a new dataset, enhancing learning efficiency and accuracy.
- **CUDA Optimization**: Implement CUDA to leverage GPU acceleration for improved model training performance.
